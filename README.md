# Spotify Clone
This project is a Spotify clone built using Flutter, designed to replicate the key features of the popular music streaming service. 
The backend is powered by PostgreSQL for database management, FastAPI for handling API requests, and Cloudinary for storing and serving music files. 
The app architecture follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, and state management is handled using Riverpod, ensuring a maintainable and efficient codebase.

## Technologies Used
Flutter: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
PostgreSQL: Database management system for storing user data, playlists, and other relevant information.
FastAPI: Backend framework for handling API requests and managing interactions with the database.
Cloudinary: Cloud-based storage solution for managing and delivering music files.
Riverpod: State management solution used to handle application state effectively.
MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
